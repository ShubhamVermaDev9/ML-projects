What is machine learning? Understanding types & applications ...
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn from data to improve performance without explicit programming

Supervised Learning (learns from labeled data for prediction), Unsupervised Learning (finds patterns in unlabeled data), Semi-Supervised Learning (combines labeled and unlabeled data), and Reinforcement Learning (learns through rewards and punishments).
